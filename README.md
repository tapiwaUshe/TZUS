# TZUS - Tapiwa Z. Ushe Solutions Portfolio Website
---------------------------------------------------
Welcome to my homepage! This serves as my digital resume, showing all of my projects in a comprehensive project in and of itself! You can easily view my interests and hobbies within the Computer Science space. Currently very focused on CyberSecurity and developing my knowledge further in all of the subjects that surround the CySec sector.
Follow my GitHub to stay updated on my future endeavours, as I will be showing off some BASH programming soon, and overall praising of the superior Linux operating system (Tallgeese project).
Many things to come for us here at TZUS (me :D) get ready for a whole lot of code, and a whole lot of nerd!
