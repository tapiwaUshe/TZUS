                    Website & Projects Revamp! - Monday, January 15th, 2022 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Wow! Can you believe that? Another New Year post for my blog! Welcome to 2022!
                    I do apologize for the late blog post... AGAIN haha.<br />
                    Truthfully, this has been a long time coming, but lots of projects are finally seeing the light of day.<br>
                    Let's get into it:
                    The Metaverse. Man, oh man. Was 2021 a wild year or WHAT? Y'all might not know this, but in December 2017, I participated <br>
                    in the worlds first ever Virtual Reality LAND parcel auction, in history (sorry, I have to talk it up). <br>
                    <a href="https://decentraland.org/" class="blogLinks">Decentraland. </a> The NYC of prime virtual-estate within the Metaverse. I claimed 3, and recently sold one for $16K USD (3.85ETH @ the time). <br>
                    This was immediately reinvested into Decentral Games ICE Poker Wearables, where I helped establish an ICE Poker Team "DiCED," or Decentral iCE. <br>
                    There are tons of new partnerships going on with my company "Decentraphile," and I'm planning to onboard many businesses and users alike into the Metaverse. <br>
                    For example, I work in risk-management... it would make perfect sense for companies within this industry to adopt a blockchain solution to assist with their efforts! <br>

                    Hey all! Welcome to the new year, 2020!
                    I do apologize for the late blog post... Ive been swamped with projects and career moves.
                    So! Where do we begin? Well, this portfolio website of mine has been a long time coming (kinda, it has been built but... never hosted).
                    & It sure is about time we take this badboy to a host we all know, right?! 
                    GitHub Pages! Here we come!<br />
